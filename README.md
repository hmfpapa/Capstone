<h3>Welcome to the Jungle!</h3>

A plant care and progress tracking app

**Created using React JS and Tailwind CSS**

<H2>Overview</H2>
For us "plant people" it can become difficult to keep up with plant care. When was this plant last fertilized? What did I change to make it start growing so quickly? In the midst of keeping the plants alive, we can also forget to appreciate growth and lose sight of how far we've come. 
<br>
This app seeks to solve these problems with an easy to use interface that allows users to add plants, track watering, fertilizing, and changes to the plant's individual care all while creating a timeline of photos to provide perspective on growth. Users can add new plants along with pictures, filter by plant type, create updates for individual plants, and view their collection through the app.

<H2>Lessons Learned</H2>
This project was created as my client side capstone for Nashville Software School. The objective was to build a single page web application using technologies learned thus far. 

<br/> 
I wanted to be able to track plant growth and care in a user-friendly app. Once I had created the initial structure, I began using the app repeatedly. In doing so, I saw opportunities for added features. This inspired me to enable the user to add more plant types, as well as fertilizer types. 

<br/>
Just as the plants are always growing, so are my skills as I learn to build a better application, to improve my understanding, and to hone in on the user experience. I'm proud of what I've created, but am eager to improve along this journey.
