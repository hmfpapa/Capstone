A plant care and progress tracking app

**Created using React JS and Tailwind CSS**

<H2>Overview</H2>
For us "plant people" it can become difficult to keep up with plant care. When was this plant last fertilized? What did I change to make it start growing so quickly? In the midst of keeping the plants alive, we can also forget to appreciate growth and lose sight of how far we've come. 
<br>
This app seeks to solve these problems with an easy to use interface that allows users to add plants, track watering, fertilizing, and changes to the plant's individual care all while creating a timeline of photos to provide perspective on growth. Users can add new plants along with pictures, filter by plant type, create updates for individual plants, and view their collection through the app.
